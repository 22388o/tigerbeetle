Explain that a transfer is a journal entry (date/description/source and target accounts/amount), but why we also add support for two-phase commit journal entries (to keep all business logic non-distributed, to support id-only fulfills), even though journal entries can also auto-commit, and that SNAP-style journal entries can be supported by the underlying data stored by TigerBeetle as materialized views.

Double-check that we explain why we don't collapse balances in the account struct.

Remove BLOBs.

Explain why we don't simply use fds to lookup static network connection buffers (the fd range includes stdin/stdout/stdout as well as all open file system fds, so this quickly exhausts our pre-allocated network buffers).
